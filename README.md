# Big Data Analytics Practice Repository

Welcome to our Big Data Analytics Practice repository! This repository contains Python scripts for various tasks related to data processing, loading, and storage in MongoDB. It also includes additional resources such as a paper, a technical report, a PowerBI project, and datasets used for the reports.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on practice environment for big data analytics. It covers a range of tasks, from data processing using Python to visualization using MS PowerBI. The primary focus is on demonstrating practical techniques for handling large volumes of data efficiently.

## Contents

1. **Python Scripts**: Contains Python scripts for data processing, loading, and storing data in MongoDB. These scripts leverage the `pymongo`, `pyspark`, and `pandas` libraries.

2. **Paper and Technical Report**: Includes a paper and a technical report detailing the methodologies, findings, and insights derived from the data analysis process.

3. **PowerBI Project**: Contains a PowerBI project file showcasing visualizations and insights extracted from the analyzed data.

4. **Datasets**: Includes datasets used for the analysis and mentioned in the paper and technical report. These datasets are provided for reference and reproducibility purposes.

## Required Packages

To run the Python scripts included in this repository, you'll need the following Python packages:

- `pymongo`: MongoDB driver for Python.
- `pyspark`: Apache Spark library for large-scale data processing.
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis library.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the Python scripts for data processing and loading into MongoDB (you can create one here: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
4. Refer to the paper and technical report for detailed insights and analysis findings.
5. Explore the PowerBI project for visualizations and interactive data exploration.
